ARDUINO FreeRTOS (2 junction)

1) 2 Tasks have been created:
	Task 1= Vehicle Traffic Light
	Task 2= Pedestrian Traffic Light

2) Priority of Task by default:
	Task 1 > Task 2

3) Interrupt has been created.
   FX interrupt : to change the priority of Tasks
			After interrupt is triggered, priority Task 2 > Task 1.

4)Task 1 is always be executing(Green vehicle & Red ped), Task 2 is suspended.
  Task 2 will only be executing if and only if there is interrupt to go to ready state(Yellow vehicle) n then allow pedestrian cross(Red vehicle & Green ped).

5) The movement of vehicle from fx East to West
   fx ready state yellow state.
   The movement of pedestrian from fx North to South

6) Chronology 
   Vehicle POV : Green vehicle > Interrupt> Yellow Ready State > Red vehicle
   Pedestrian POV : Red pedestrian > Interrupt> Yellow Ready State > Green pedestrian

7) Try to create adaptive pedestrian traffic light to reduce waitg time for vehicle

8) Steps:1) Create object pedestrian
         2) Pedestrian will enter the queue array to indicates that there is pedestrian.
         3) Interrupt masuk tanda pendestrian smpai
         4)Calculate the no of pedestrian arrive (can also calculate the no of pedestrian que)
         5) The period pedestrian traffic light will be executed will be measured based on how many pedestrian in queue array
		If 1 queue, period would be 10s, If 2 queues period would be 15s
